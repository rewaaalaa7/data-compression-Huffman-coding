# Data Compression Using Huffman Coding

This project implements lossless data compression for text files using Huffman coding. It includes both compression and decompression functionalities and features a web page that allows users to upload a text file and receive a compressed version of the file.

## Project Overview

Huffman coding is an algorithm used for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This results in a compressed file that is smaller in size compared to the original file. The compression and decompression processes are as follows:

1. **Compression**:
    - The algorithm reads the input text file and calculates the frequency of each character.
    - It builds a binary tree (Huffman tree) where each leaf node represents a character from the input file, and the path from the root to the leaf node represents the character's code.
    - The original text file is then encoded using these variable-length codes, resulting in a compressed file.

2. **Decompression**:
    - The compressed file is decoded back to the original text file by traversing the Huffman tree based on the binary codes.

## Features

- **Huffman Coding Algorithm**: Implements the core Huffman coding algorithm for both compression and decompression.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web page where users can upload their text files and download the compressed version.
- **Lossless Compression**: Ensures that the decompressed file is identical to the original file with no data loss.

## How to Use

### Web Interface

1. Open the web page in your browser.
2. Upload your text file using the provided file input.

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-repository
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the local server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the web interface.


## Future Enhancements

- Add support for compressing other file types.
- Improve the user interface for better user experience.
- Implement additional compression algorithms for comparison.
